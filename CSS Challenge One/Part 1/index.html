          Hi, my name is Stefan. There's not a whole lot to say about me. I work
          a lot (in construction) and go to school. If I'm not doing one of
          those things, I'm probably playing hockey or working out. I also have
          a dog, he's much more interesting to look at and talk about.
        </p>

          <!--figcaption giving some context to the user about the image-->
          <figcaption>See? Much more interesting. What is his fascination with clothes hangers? 
            We'll never know!
